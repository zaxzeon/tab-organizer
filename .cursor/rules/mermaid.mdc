description: How and When to use Mermaid Diagrams
alwaysApply: true

If at any point a mermaid diagram would make your plan or point clearer to help the user, or yourself, quickly see the structure, you are encouraged to include a Mermaid code block in the response.

(Important Note: if you use colors in your mermaid diagrams, be sure to use high contrast colors so the text is readable.) Make your mermaid diagrams have good visual hierarchy and aim for clarity and aesthetic diagrams.
